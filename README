An object-oriented implementation inspired by "How to Design Classes"

The interesting part is the decomposition of the elements in the game
and the Double Buffer Strategy implementation, which is when you know
it fairly simple.

It lacks an Input-System from the user, which can be easily
implemented, by adding a method for UFOWorld which will pass the Key
Event on to the Player/AUP and it will handle the correct update.
